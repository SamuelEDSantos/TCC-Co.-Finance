# TCC-Co.-Finance
Investment Portfolio Management Platform for Beginners
This project was initially developed as a Course Completion Work (TCC) and aims to assist beginner investors in managing their investment portfolios. The goal is to provide an intuitive and accessible platform, allowing users with little experience in the financial market to track and manage their investments efficiently, based on concrete data.

To achieve this objective, several features have been implemented to facilitate financial planning and strategic decision-making. The key functionalities include:

1. Fixed Income Calculator with Graph Visualization
One of the platform’s fundamental tools is the fixed income calculator, which enables users to simulate investments in fixed-income assets such as CDBs, LCIs, LCAs, and Treasury Bonds. After the simulation, the system generates a graph illustrating the investment's growth over time, helping investors visualize their expected returns. This feature allows beginners to make more informed decisions when selecting financial products suited to their needs.

2. Portfolio Diversification Based on Investor Profile
The platform also includes a portfolio diversification tool designed to suggest the optimal allocation of assets based on the user’s investor profile (conservative, moderate, or aggressive). This ensures a balanced risk-return ratio, helping beginners understand the importance of diversification and how to structure an efficient investment portfolio while minimizing exposure to excessive risks.

3. Stock Market Data Retrieval Using the Alpha Vantage API
For users interested in the stock market, the platform integrates the Alpha Vantage API, one of the most reliable sources for real-time financial data. With this feature, users can search for and access detailed information on publicly traded stocks, including historical prices, fluctuations, and key indicators. This tool helps investors analyze trends and identify promising assets for their portfolios.

Objective and Benefits
This project was developed to provide beginner investors with essential tools for more effective financial management. By combining simulations, diversification strategies, and up-to-date stock market information, the platform aims to democratize access to financial knowledge and encourage safer and well-founded investment practices.

With an intuitive interface and visual resources such as graphs and reports, the system simplifies complex financial concepts, making the investor’s experience more educational and interactive. This way, the project serves as a strategic ally for those taking their first steps into the world of investments, helping them make informed and confident financial decisions.
